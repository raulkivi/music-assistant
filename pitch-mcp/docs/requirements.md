# pitch-mcp Requirements

## Purpose

Detect a singer's pitch from microphone audio and compare it against a reference MusicXML score. Report the singer's current position in the score and their pitch accuracy in real time.

Covers **Goal 4** (show current score position while singing), **Goal 5** (show pitch accuracy), and **Goal 6** (identify position from hummed/sung melody).

---

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1 — Offline recording analysis

The server MUST accept a pre-recorded WAV file and a reference MusicXML score, and return a note-by-note analysis of the singer's pitch accuracy.

The response MUST include:

- Total measures covered
- Average pitch deviation in cents
- Per-note breakdown: measure number, beat position, expected note name, detected frequency in Hz, deviation in cents, status
- Accuracy histogram: counts of on-pitch, sharp, flat, and no-signal notes

### FR-2 — Score loading

The server MUST accept a MusicXML document and a part name, parse the reference note sequence, and return a session ID.

The session MUST persist in server memory until explicitly stopped or the server restarts.

### FR-3 — Real-time monitoring start

The server MUST open the system microphone and begin pitch detection for the given session.

If no microphone is available or access is denied, the server MUST return a clear error.

### FR-4 — Real-time position polling

While monitoring is active, the server MUST return the current score position and pitch accuracy in response to poll requests.

Each response MUST include:

- Session ID
- Current measure number and beat position
- Expected note name at that position
- Detected pitch in Hz
- Deviation in cents from expected pitch
- Status: `on_pitch`, `sharp`, `flat`, or `no_signal`

### FR-5 — Real-time monitoring stop

The server MUST stop the microphone stream, clean up the session, and return a summary when requested.

The summary MUST include total measures sung, average accuracy in cents, and an accuracy histogram.

### FR-6 — Capability reporting

The server MUST expose a tool that returns:

- Server name and version
- Supported input formats
- Active pitch detection backend and version
- Microphone availability flag
- List of available tools

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1 — Pitch detection accuracy

The pitch detector MUST return the correct note name (within ±25 cents) for a clearly sung note at typical choir singing levels. This threshold defines the `on_pitch` boundary.

### NFR-2 — Latency

In real-time mode, the lag between a singer producing a note and the server reporting the detected pitch via `get_current_position` MUST be under 500 milliseconds.

### NFR-3 — Audio format

The offline analysis tool (`analyze_recording`) MUST accept 16-bit PCM WAV files. MP3 and FLAC MUST be rejected with a clear `UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT` error.

### NFR-4 — Session isolation

Multiple concurrent sessions MUST be supported. Each session MUST maintain independent state (loaded score, audio buffer, current position).

### NFR-5 — Offline analysis independence

`analyze_recording` MUST work without a microphone or PortAudio. It MUST NOT fail or skip due to missing audio hardware.

### NFR-6 — Transport

The server MUST communicate via MCP stdio transport.

---

## Interface Requirements

### IR-1 — MCP protocol

The server MUST implement MCP using `mcp.server.stdio.stdio_server()`.

### IR-2 — Tool: `analyze_recording`

```
Input:
  audio_path  string  required  absolute path to a 16-bit PCM WAV file
  musicxml    string  required  MusicXML document as a string

```

### IR-3 — Tool: `load_score`

```

  musicxml   string  required  MusicXML document as a string
  part_name  string  required  name of the part to monitor against

Output:
  session_id       string
  part_name        string
  measure_count    integer
  duration_seconds float
```

### IR-4 — Tool: `start_monitoring`

```
Input:
  session_id  string   required
  tempo_bpm   integer  optional  override score tempo; default: score tempo

Output:
  status      string  "started"
  session_id  string
```

### IR-5 — Tool: `get_current_position`

```
Input:
  session_id  string  required

Output:
  session_id      string
  measure         integer
  beat            float
  expected_note   string   e.g. "E4"
  sung_pitch_hz   float
  accuracy_cents  float
  status          string   "on_pitch" | "sharp" | "flat" | "no_signal"
```

Status thresholds:
- `on_pitch`: deviation within ±25 cents
- `sharp`: deviation > +25 cents
- `flat`: deviation < −25 cents
- `no_signal`: no detectable pitch in the audio window

### IR-6 — Tool: `stop_monitoring`

### IR-8 — Environment variable

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PITCH_BACKEND` | `librosa` | Pitch detection backend: `librosa` or `crepe` |

`crepe` requires a manual TensorFlow install and is not tested in CI.

### IR-9 — Error response format

```json
{"error": "<human-readable message>", "error_code": "<CODE>"}
```

| Code | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| `FILE_NOT_FOUND` | Audio file path does not exist |
| `UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT` | Audio file is not 16-bit PCM WAV |
| `INVALID_INPUT` | MusicXML cannot be parsed |
| `INVALID_PARAMETER` | Part name not found in score |
| `SESSION_NOT_FOUND` | session_id is unknown; call `load_score` first |
| `PROCESSING_FAILED` | Microphone unavailable; no pitch detected; audio hardware error |

---

## Constraints

- Language: Python 3.12+
- Package manager: uv
- Score parsing: music21
- Primary pitch detection backend: librosa pYIN (`librosa.pyin`) — pure Python, no system deps
- Real-time audio: sounddevice — installs without a build step; requires `libportaudio2` at runtime
- Real-time pitch detection in the audio callback thread uses YIN autocorrelation — no heavy libraries in the audio thread
- Score alignment: DTW via dtaidistance
- `aubio` is excluded: no Python 3.13 wheel
- `crepe` is excluded from default install: build failure in uv due to missing `pkg_resources`
- Audio callback MUST NOT perform I/O, locking, or heavy computation — keep it minimal

---

## Testing Requirements

### TR-1 — Unit tests

Unit tests MUST cover:

- Hz-to-note conversion including cents deviation
- Note sequence extraction from a SATB MusicXML fixture
- Session lifecycle: create, start, poll, stop, verify cleanup
- `FILE_NOT_FOUND` error for missing audio file
- `UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT` error for non-WAV input
- Unknown part name error
- Unknown session ID error
- `list_capabilities` response schema

Unit tests MUST mock sounddevice and dtaidistance.

### TR-2 — Integration tests

Integration tests MUST:

- Be marked `@pytest.mark.integration`
- Run `analyze_recording` on a committed fixture WAV with a matching MXL
- Assert the response contains `note_accuracy` with at least one entry
- Assert `avg_accuracy_cents` is a finite number
- Run without a microphone (offline analysis only)

### TR-3 — Manual tests

Real-microphone tests MUST:

- Be marked `@pytest.mark.manual`
- Be excluded from CI runs
- Test the full `load_score` → `start_monitoring` → `get_current_position` → `stop_monitoring` lifecycle

### TR-4 — Test fixtures

A short (~10–20 second) soprano vocal WAV file and a matching reference MusicXML MUST be committed to `tests/fixtures/` for integration tests.
