# pitch-mcp — Claude Code Instructions

## What This Server Does

Real-time pitch detection from microphone input compared against a reference MusicXML score.
Reports current score position (measure + beat), pitch accuracy in cents, and sharp/flat/on-pitch
status while a singer sings.

**Status:** Phase A (offline analysis) + Phase B (real-time, audio-driven position tracking)
complete. 112 unit + 4 integration tests pass (`-m integration`); 2 manual mic tests
(`-m manual`) require real hardware.

## Running Tests

```bash
# From this directory
VIRTUAL_ENV= .venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v                 # 112 unit tests (integration/manual skipped by default)
VIRTUAL_ENV= .venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v -m integration   # offline analysis against the committed fixture pair
VIRTUAL_ENV= .venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v -m manual        # real mic tests — skip in CI
```

Install dependencies: `uv sync`

## Implemented Tools

| Tool | Phase | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `analyze_recording` | A | Pre-recorded WAV + MusicXML → per-note accuracy report |
| `load_score` | B | Load MusicXML into a session, return session_id |
| `start_monitoring` | B | Open mic stream for a session |
| `get_current_position` | B | Current measure/beat/pitch/accuracy from active session |
| `stop_monitoring` | B | Stop stream, return summary, clean up session |
| `list_capabilities` | — | Server metadata, pitch backend version |

---

## Environment

- **Primary pitch backend:** `librosa.pyin` — pure Python, no system deps, excellent for voice
- **Real-time (Phase B):** `sounddevice` + YIN autocorrelation in worker thread
- **System dep:** `libportaudio2` required at runtime for real-time streams (Phase B only)
  Offline analysis (Phase A / `analyze_recording`) has no system deps.
- **MXL fixtures:** `../omr-mcp/test_samples/pdmx_satb_samples/mxl/` (10 SATB files)

---

## Hard Rules

- **Never `pip install`** — use `uv sync` or `uv add`
- **`engine.py` must not import from `mcp`** — keeps it unit-testable
- **All tool handlers must be `async def`**
- **All errors** → `{"error": "...", "error_code": "..."}` (codes: `FILE_NOT_FOUND`, `UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT`, `INVALID_INPUT`, `PROCESSING_FAILED`, `INVALID_PARAMETER`, `SESSION_NOT_FOUND`)
- **Integration tests** must be `@pytest.mark.integration`; manual mic tests `@pytest.mark.manual`
- **Audio callback must never do I/O or locking** — queue chunks to a `queue.Queue` only

---

## MCP Server Startup Pattern

```python
import asyncio
import mcp.server.stdio

async def _run():
    async with mcp.server.stdio.stdio_server() as (read_stream, write_stream):
        await app.run(read_stream, write_stream, app.create_initialization_options())

asyncio.run(_run())
```

`run_server()` does not exist in the installed MCP SDK — use the context manager above.

---

## Known Gotchas

- **`crepe` fails to build under uv** (missing `pkg_resources`) — keep as manual opt-in only;
  do not add it to default dependencies.
- **`aubio` has no Python 3.13 wheel** and requires `libportaudio2` + `libsamplerate` — use
  `librosa` instead for all pitch detection.
- **`sounddevice` streams fail at runtime** if `libportaudio2` is absent. Phase B real-time
  features simply won't work on machines without it; Phase A is unaffected.
- **This is the only stateful server.** Sessions are held in module-level dict `_sessions`.
  Use `threading.Lock` to protect shared state accessed by the audio callback thread and tool
  handlers. Never do I/O inside the audio callback — only queue chunks.
- **`analyze_recording` accepts 16-bit PCM WAV only.** Reject MP3/FLAC with `UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT`.
- **Accuracy thresholds:** on_pitch = ±25 cents; sharp = >+25 cents; flat = <−25 cents.

## Document Update Policy

When you finish work or reach a milestone, update:
1. `docs/HANDOVER.md` — check off done items, add new gotchas
2. `docs/PLAN.md` — check off phase items, note changed decisions
3. `docs/requirements.md` — update if behaviour changed
4. `docs/architecture.md` — update if implementation changed
