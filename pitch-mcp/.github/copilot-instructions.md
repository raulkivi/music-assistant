# pitch-mcp — Copilot Instructions

## What This Server Does

Real-time pitch detection from microphone input compared against a reference MusicXML score.
Reports current score position (measure + beat), pitch accuracy in cents, and sharp/flat/on-pitch
status while a singer sings. This is the most complex server in the project — it is stateful.

**Status:** Phase A (offline analysis) + Phase B (real-time, audio-driven position tracking)
complete. 112 unit + 4 integration tests pass (`-m integration`); 2 manual mic tests
(`-m manual`) require real hardware.

## Before You Write Any Code

Read these documents in order:
1. **`docs/HANDOVER.md`** — current status, remaining work, pre-flight checks, known gotchas, definition of done
2. **`docs/PLAN.md`** — architecture decisions and technology rationale
3. **`docs/requirements.md`** — functional and non-functional requirements, error codes
4. **`docs/architecture.md`** — component diagram, data-flow, module responsibilities

MXL test fixtures are in `../omr-mcp/test_samples/pdmx_satb_samples/mxl/` — 10 SATB files.

## Implemented Tools

| Tool | Phase | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `analyze_recording` | A | Pre-recorded WAV + MusicXML → per-note pitch accuracy report |
| `load_score` | B | Load MusicXML into session, return session_id |
| `start_monitoring` | B | Open mic stream for a session |
| `get_current_position` | B | Current measure/beat/pitch/accuracy from active session |
| `stop_monitoring` | B | Stop stream, return summary, clean up session |
| `list_capabilities` | — | Server metadata, pitch backend and version |

---

## Environment

- **Primary pitch backend:** `librosa.pyin` — pure Python, no system deps, excellent for voice
- **Real-time (Phase B):** `sounddevice` + YIN autocorrelation in worker thread
- **System dep for Phase B:** `libportaudio2` — must be present for real-time streams
  Phase A (`analyze_recording`) has no system dependencies
- **`crepe`:** fails to build under uv — do not add to default deps; keep as manual opt-in only
- **`aubio`:** no Python 3.13 wheel — do not use; use librosa instead

---

## Coding Standards

- **Package manager:** `uv` only — never `pip install`
- **`engine.py` must not import from `mcp`** — keeps it independently unit-testable
- **All tool handlers must be `async def`**
- **All error responses:** `{"error": "human description", "error_code": "SCREAMING_SNAKE"}`
- **Standard error codes:** `FILE_NOT_FOUND`, `UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT`, `INVALID_INPUT`, `PROCESSING_FAILED`, `INVALID_PARAMETER`, `SESSION_NOT_FOUND`
- **Integration tests** → `@pytest.mark.integration`; real-mic tests → `@pytest.mark.manual`
- **Audio callback must never do I/O or locking** — queue audio chunks to `queue.Queue` only
- **Python 3.12+**; `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in pytest config

---

## Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests only (fast, no mic needed) — integration/manual are skipped by default
VIRTUAL_ENV= .venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v

# Integration tests only (offline analysis against the committed fixture pair)
VIRTUAL_ENV= .venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v -m integration

# Manual tests (real mic — skip in CI)
VIRTUAL_ENV= .venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v -m manual

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

## MCP Server Startup Pattern

```python
import asyncio
import mcp.server.stdio

async def _run():
    async with mcp.server.stdio.stdio_server() as (read_stream, write_stream):
        await app.run(read_stream, write_stream, app.create_initialization_options())

asyncio.run(_run())
```

`mcp.server.stdio.run_server()` does not exist — always use the context manager above.

---

## Known Gotchas

- **`crepe` fails to build under uv** (missing `pkg_resources`) — do not add to dependencies.
- **`aubio` has no Python 3.13 wheel** — use `librosa` for all pitch detection.
- **sounddevice streams require `libportaudio2`** at runtime. Phase A works without it.
- **This is the only stateful server.** Sessions live in a module-level dict in `engine.py`.
  Protect shared state with `threading.Lock` — both the audio callback thread and MCP handlers
  access session state.
- **Audio callback constraint:** never do I/O, locking, or heavy computation inside the
  sounddevice callback. Only write chunks to a `queue.Queue`.
- **`analyze_recording` accepts 16-bit PCM WAV only.** Reject MP3/FLAC with `UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT`.
- **Accuracy thresholds:** on_pitch = ±25 cents; sharp = >+25 cents; flat = <−25 cents.
- **Session cleanup:** `stop_monitoring` must delete the session — a second call must return
  `SESSION_NOT_FOUND`.
- **DTW always assigns every note ≥1 frame.** `aligner.align`'s `dtaidistance.dtw.warping_path`
  call is full-coverage, so a note the singer never attempted still gets forced onto some frame —
  compensated with a temporal-plausibility gate afterward. Don't remove that gate without keeping
  `no_signal` behavior for unsung notes.
- **Phase B position is audio-driven, not wall-clock.** `ScoreSession._process_pitch_frame` /
  `_find_best_note_index` pick the current note by pitch match within a forward lookahead, not
  purely by elapsed time. `_note_idx` must never move backward.

## When You Finish Work

Update these documents so the next session starts with accurate information:
- **`docs/HANDOVER.md`** — check off done items, add new gotchas, update status
- **`docs/PLAN.md`** — check off completed phase items, note changed decisions
- **`docs/requirements.md`** — update if behaviour or interfaces changed
- **`docs/architecture.md`** — update if implementation structure changed
